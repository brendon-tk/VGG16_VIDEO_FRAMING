#VGG16 Video Framing

Overview

This repository implements a video frame analysis pipeline using the VGG16 deep learning architecture. The purpose is to extract high-level features from video frames for tasks such as classification, object detection, or video summarization.

Features

Preprocessing pipeline for extracting and resizing frames from videos.

Integration of the pre-trained VGG16 model for feature extraction.

Customizable frame sampling rate for processing efficiency.

Option to fine-tune VGG16 for specific tasks.

Visualization of extracted features and results.

Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.8 or higher

Libraries:

opencv-python

tensorflow/keras

numpy

matplotlib

tqdm

Install dependencies with:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Installation

Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/brendon-tk/VGG16_VIDEO_FRAMING.git

Navigate to the project directory:

cd VGG16_VIDEO_FRAMING

Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

Place video files in the videos/ directory.

Extract frames from videos:

python extract_frames.py --video_path videos/sample_video.mp4 --output_dir frames/

Perform feature extraction using VGG16:

python extract_features.py --frames_dir frames/ --output_file features.csv

Visualize extracted features (optional):

python visualize_features.py --features_file features.csv

Results

Extracted features are saved in .csv or .npy format for downstream tasks.

Visualizations provide insights into the feature space for each frame.
